# haiiieloo!! waves at yuo (Tw:Yap,opinions) 

I know my skins are not the best, imo my shadings are pretty humble. BUT i am VERY sensitive when it comes to copying skins topics,(pony town) for the record,i've never copy anyone's skin. I can just ask them for inspo,not copying it.(if you refuse 2 believe ? Sure buddy, srry but that's none of my business,i am here 2 enjoy the game not causing shitty dramas. +block.) If you want 2 take inspo or smth from my skin,just ask me. But hvy inspo makes me uncomf and i will likely b decline it.(Copying is a big no)

But in other topics i am fine.  

Antis or problematic trolls,racists pls get off. Ew.

I am random,so expect some info dumping or stupid shii :3 

Sometimes my mood swings might kicked in,be aware brhhahala.

I am pretty bad at explaining stuff. I might struggle with it alot. So pls b patient.. :( 

I can match your energy pretty quick,so don't be afraid 2 cuddle/talk 2 me ^^(especially when it comes 2 roblox,old media stuff,BANDS!!.)

HOMESTUCKLINGS PLS INTT (brostrider heavy dni)

ANYTHING INC3ST. NO. GET AWAY PLS.

(Would add more in the future.) 

Anyways. Enjoy your day. <3
